I have a very important announcement. As of right now I will be turning off the server's in Monkey Mayhem from now and until the new rebuilt version of Monkey Mayhem comes out. I am doing this because when I started this project back in December I had no clue what I was getting into, because of that everything very very unorganized. I want to make Monkey Mayhem way better for the future, I want Monkey Mayhem to be up there with all these other great fan games. So because of that there will be no more update's or leaks until everything is finished and polished to be great again, thanks for playing Monkey Mayhem - FrostyDoggo.
